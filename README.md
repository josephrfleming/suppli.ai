Suppli Ai is a personalized supplement recommendation app that helps users make smarter health decisions based on science—not hype. Users enter their health goals, budget, dietary preferences, and current medications/supplements, and the app generates a customized stack of recommendations using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

Each recommendation includes:

Estimated monthly cost

Dosage and usage info

Retailer link (iHerb only, for safety and transparency)

PubMed research link for evidence-backed results
